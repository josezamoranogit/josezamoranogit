As a dedicated IT Security Analyst with a deep passion for cybersecurity, I have experience analyzing and responding to security alerts, tuning detection signatures, and performed phishing email investigations. Proficient in Kusto Query Language (KQL), I’ve automated alert investigations to streamline incident response. My background includes installing and maintaining SIEM logging agents, investigating network anomalies, and enhancing SIEM dashboards. I have worked on a firewall upgrade project where I updated firmware, applied firewall configurations, ensured error-free policies, and assisted onsite personnel with the installation and setup of multiple firewalls. Implemented Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices throughout the lifecycle of network accounts at various organizations. While I recognize there’s still much to learn, I’m proud of my progress and excited about what my future holds in cybersecurity. I can go on and on about my experience, but this would turn in to a resume...
